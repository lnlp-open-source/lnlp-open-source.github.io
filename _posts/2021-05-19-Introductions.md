# Introductions

[LexisNexis Legal & Professional](https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/about-us/about-us.page) engineering is a global with offices and developers working around the globe to advance
the rule of law.

This blog is a new venture for the engineering team and we look forward to sharing our development experiences and insights.

Developing software has always accompanied by change. Changes in process, changes in platforms, tools. Just about
everything continues to be in a state of change.

By sharing our stories and insights we hope to contribute something of value that can help others in their learning journey.
