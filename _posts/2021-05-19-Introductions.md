# Introductions

Sitting down to write this first post in a new blog that will over time represent engineering at LexisNexis is a daunting task. This is a new venture. The company has a long history providing applications and services to the legal profession. Check out our web site [LexisNexis Legal & Professional](https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/about-us/about-us.page) for details.

But blogging and sharing our software development practices is a new venture. For those of you that are comfortable in the sharing world it might be hard to recognize that this change is a pretty substantial change and accompanied by challenges and risks. If you work for a company that does not have an a social sharing outlet maybe this contribution might encourage you to at least have the conversation.

There are many reasons to start a blog. When I joined LexisNexis a few years ago I had spent around 15 years in consulting and sharing experiences was not only accepted but encouraged. After all we all progress and imporove by sharing ideas and innovations in the way that software is built and delivered. The Legal domain is fascinatingly complex and steeped in history, conventions. How we model this domain requires a corresponding complexity in the domain logic of our systems.  

After joining LexisNexis as Chief engineer one of my goals is to open the doors to the engineering work of my collegues. To create a platform for them to be able to share the innovations, challenges and approaches that we use to deliver the software systems that fuel our products and provide value to our customers.

This blog is a part of that goal. Sharing take practice focus. In addition to sharing our software development experiences we are also working to contribute to the evergrowing wealth of open source software. By sharing we hope that others may benefit from our contributions and continue to push the boundaries of the possible.

As with every new adventure we have taken the first step, with our first open source project and our first article. Its the first step of what I expect to be many.
