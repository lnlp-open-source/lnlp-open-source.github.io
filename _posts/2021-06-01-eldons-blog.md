There's something cathartic about commiserating in awful shared experiences -- especially if you can find humor in them. Like that one time you were working on four hours of sleep and included a typo in a blog post title. The typo got included in a notification to all of your email and RSS subscribers, and they all made fun of you in the comments for being a terrible, horrible, no good blogger. Horrifying at the time (seriously, you will never make that mistake again!!), but when you describe the situation later to a fellow blogger, it's funny and makes everyone feel a little better about that same situation happening to them. 

That is the precise reason why I love funny marketing blogs -- they somehow manage to identify all of the awful, frustrating, and down-right hilarious things that happen in our marketing jobs. And the following 10 are ones that really take the cake. So if you've had a rough week or just need a few minutes to hear about someone who has, check them out. Be warned: Some of these blogs include profane language.

Okay okay, this isn't exactly a blog -- it's an art project -- but it's hilarious and definitely deserves to be included here. It's basically "Clients From Hell" ... but in visual format. And trust me, the visual format is what makes it. Just look at an excerpt below to see what I mean. I check them out and wonder if real human beings actually say some of these things -- while also knowing that I've definitely said at least one of them in my lifetime.
