description: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

#### 5 Hilarious Blogs That'll Make You Feel Better About Your Job

There's something cathartic about commiserating in awful shared experiences -- especially if you can find humor in them. Like that one time you were working on four hours of sleep and included a typo in a blog post title. The typo got included in a notification to all of your email and RSS subscribers, and they all made fun of you in the comments for being a terrible, horrible, no good blogger. Horrifying at the time (seriously, you will never make that mistake again!!), but when you describe the situation later to a fellow blogger, it's funny and makes everyone feel a little better about that same situation happening to them. 

That is the precise reason why I love funny marketing blogs -- they somehow manage to identify all of the awful, frustrating, and down-right hilarious things that happen in our marketing jobs. And the following 10 are ones that really take the cake. So if you've had a rough week or just need a few minutes to hear about someone who has, check them out. Be warned: Some of these blogs include profane language.

#### Sharp Suits
Okay okay, this isn't exactly a blog -- it's an art project -- but it's hilarious and definitely deserves to be included here. It's basically "Clients From Hell" ... but in visual format. And trust me, the visual format is what makes it. Just look at an excerpt below to see what I mean. I check them out and wonder if real human beings actually say some of these things -- while also knowing that I've definitely said at least one of them in my lifetime. 

#### Tom Reads His Spam
Spam is slowly taking over the internet. It's overflowing inboxes, dominating comments, and even creeping into Twitter accounts. It's funny enough when you see it ... but have you ever listened to it? Lucky for us, Tom Webster, VP of Strategy and Marketing at Edison Research, makes listening to spam possible -- and hilarious. Embedded below is my favorite one, but definitely give his blog a gander.

#### What Should We Call Social Media
Lots of us manage our company's social media accounts, which comes with a whole bunch of highs and lows. You're scared of getting called out by unhappy customers. You're pumped when someone influential mentions you. You're scared of making a typo (just like our blogger friends). And then you're pumped when someone favorites something of yours (Yes! Engagement!). With all of these universal, polarized emotions, it's only natural that someone would capture these highs and lows on a blog with GIFs. 

#### I Love Charts

You already know how to make gorgeous charts and graphs, so you'll know well-designed -- and hilarious -- graphs when you see them. If you love visual content, pop culture, and snark, which sometimes turn into full-out rants, you seriously have to check out this blog.
