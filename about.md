# Welcome!

LexisNexis development teams are dotted all around the world and work on exciting, cutting-edge software that helps advance the rule of law. We created this tech blog to provide a space for them to share their experience and expertise with the global software development community, and to create a dialog around good practice and effective collaboration.

We love to code, and continuous learning, experimentation and openness are a core part of how we work. This is why we chose GitHub as a technical blogging platform that supports source code natively with deep integration into open-source.

We are only starting out so please stay tuned as our content grows.
