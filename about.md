# Welcome!

LexisNexis development teams are dotted all around the world and work on exciting, cutting-edge software that helps advance the rule of law. We created this Tech blog to provide a space for them to share their experience and expertise with the global software development community, and to create a dialog around good practice and effective collaboration.

We love to code, and continuous learning, experimentation and openness are a core part of how we work. This is why we chose GitHub as a technical blogging platform that supports source code natively with deep integration into open-source.

We are only starting out so please stay tuned for growing content on software development. We will be covering  general development and engineering practices, specialist topics like automated testing and specialist challenges from scale, as well as the people side, like empowered, autonomous teams.

Got any questions or feedback? We'd love to hear from you @????
