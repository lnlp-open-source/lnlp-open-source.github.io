Welcome!

[LexisNexis](https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/home.page) Technology Blog is a new venture and we hope that you find
something of interest and you visit more often. Please consider subscribing!!

## A new endeavor

Like many organizations that develop software solutions we advance our skills and knowledge shared by others. By
publishing technology blog articles of our experiences and learnings we hope to make a contribution to the community at
large and help developers around the globe facing the same or similar challenges that we have faced, offering our
solution to those problems.

LexisNexis development teams are dotted all around the world and work on exciting, cutting-edge software that helps
advance the rule of law. We created this Tech blog to provide a space for them to share their experience and expertise
with the global software development community, and to create a dialog around good practice and effective collaboration.
We love to code, and continuous learning, experimentation and openness are a core part of how we work. This is why we
chose GitHub as a technical blogging platform that supports source code natively with deep integration into open-source.
We are only starting out so please stay tuned for growing content on software engineering:

Got any questions or feedback? We'd love to hear from you @????
